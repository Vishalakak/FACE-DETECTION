# Face Detection Using Python and Computer Vision

This project demonstrates how to perform **face detection** using Python and **OpenCV**, a popular computer vision library. The project uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images or video streams.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using a webcam.
- Detection in images and video files.
- Ability to save detected faces as separate images.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.

You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless numpy
